It is analysis and simulation model about Diameter-credit-control-protocal

1.	Background

Current-day 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks charging system is not designed for Machine Type Communications (MTC) applications. 
The existing charging mechanisms usually just consider the traffic characteristics of human-based communication applications (i.e. a call session long, download data volume). 
However, MTC traffic characteristics are quite different to human-base traffic characteristics. The objective of this thesis is to propose a new credit reservation procedure, called Multiple Event-based Credit Reservation (MECR) to be make use of online charging for MTC services. We develop an analytical model and extensive simulation to in- vestigate the MECR procedure performance. Numerical results show that our MECR procedure can significantly reduce Credit Control Request (CCR) messages and bulk Charging Data Records (CDRs).
Proposed method can see the document Background principle.pdf
